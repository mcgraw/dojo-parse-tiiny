Example code for a Parse tutorial @ xmcgraw.com

In this example we're building a clone of Tiiny, a fun and no-pressure photo app recently released on iOS.

This repository maintains two projects:

Base - The project without Parse that you can use to follow along @ xmcgraw.com

Final - The final project that I've put together
